Kaggle's [Data Science for Good: Kiva Crowdfunding challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/kiva/data-science-for-good-kiva-crowdfunding) asks users to examine the data found in a dataset of [Kiva](https://www.kiva.org/) loans. The data contains information including the borrower, region, sector, and activity of the loan. The goal was to predict welfare levels of a borrower using this data. 

Here, an exploratory analysis of the data is performed. We find patterns related to location, demographics, and Multinational Poverty Index (MPI) in the loan data.
